Steps involved - 


Step 1: Create the Input File (SORTIN)
Open ISPF (Interactive System Productivity Facility).
Navigate to Option 3.2 (Data Set Utility) to create a new PS file.
Enter the dataset name userid.JCL.SORTIN and specify:
RECFM: FB (Fixed Block)
LRECL: 80 (Record Length of 80 bytes)
BLKSIZE: 800 (Optional)
Save the dataset.
Edit userid.JCL.SORTIN using ISPF 3.4 and manually enter 100 records.
Ensure that the primary key is located in columns 13-20.
Include 10 duplicate records and ensure the data is in random order.


Step 2: Write the JCL Job (SORTJOB.jcl)
Inside the userid.JCL folder, create a new JCL script named SORTJOB.jcl.
Open the file and enter the JCL SORT utility script to:
Read from userid.JCL.SORTIN
Remove duplicate records
Sort the unique records based on columns 13-20
Write the output to userid.JCL.SORTOUT


Step 3: Submit the Job
Open the JCL file SORTJOB.jcl.
Right-click on SORTJOB.jcl and select Submit Job.
Check the Job Status in the SDSF (Option S.ST).
If the job completes successfully (MAXCC = 0), proceed to the next step.


Step 4: Verify the Output File (SORTOUT)
Navigate to ISPF 3.4.
Open the dataset userid.JCL.SORTOUT.


Confirm that:
The duplicate records have been removed.
The remaining 90 records are sorted by the primary key (columns 13-20).
